# things we need:

# if user wants to add, edit, or delete a new task
# if add -> ask what they want to add -> add to list which has a number assigned to it 
# if edit -> ask for which number of task wanted to change -> prompt for new entry
# if delete -> ask for which number of task -> remove from list
# list tasks
# exit program
# complete a task

# display a list of menu options
# user will select an option
# add- run addTask() -> return to menu
# edit - run editTask() -> return to menu
# delete - run deleteTask() -> return to menu
# complete - run completeTask() - return to menu
# exit - break loop
# read the input and call function 
# return to menu

# completeTask() -> if isDone = false -> mark complete
